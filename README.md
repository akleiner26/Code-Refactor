# Code Refactor for Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc.

## Description

When the code for this site was originally sent for editing, it was a functioning website, but lacked the user accessibility and semantic structure that coders strive for in the modern era. It is the web developer's responsibility to ensure accessibility to all users, including those who either suffer from handicaps or those with socio-economic restrictions.

By simply adjusting the source code to flow with modern semantic language, rather than separating cells with div tags, the code became easier to read for other coders to edit. It also became more accessible to web users with disabilities. This included adding tags such as: title, header, body, section, and alt attributes to images.

Another big step taken was to move any image sources from the relative CSS file to the source
html file. This ensured a consistent code, while still maintaining the original functionality and design of the website.

By making these changes, Horiseon's webpage is now more accessible to all users who visit their webpage. The code is better organized for future web designers to alter the page's source code, while also optimizing search engine performance.
